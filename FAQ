  1. What platforms are supported by ITun ?
  
     Now it works only on Linux.

  2. What do I need to run ITun ?
  
     You only need to add support 
     Universal TUN/TAP device driver support
     in your Linux kernel.

  3. Can I create tunnel via NAT ?
  
     Yes !!! It works via NAT but only when initiator of connection
     is peer which is hided behind NAT. 
     Don't forget to select Connection scheme 1 (config.h) on peer with fake ip
     (PC hide behind NAT) and Connection scheme 2 on peer with real ip.

  4. For what need Connection scheme 3 ?
       
     It need to be selected on both peers when they have real ip addresses.
     With Connection scheme 3 both peers exchange only ICMP_ECHOREPLY packets
     it allows to avoid unnecessary ICMP_ECHOREPLY packets which generated by kernel
     as response to ICMP_ECHO.
